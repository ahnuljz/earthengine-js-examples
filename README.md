The Earth Engine JavaScript examples contained in this repository are adopted from [google/earthengine-api/javascript/src/examples](https://github.com/google/earthengine-api/tree/master/javascript/src/examples). The purpose is to use these examples for the [geemap](https://github.com/giswqs/geemap) Python package without having to clone the entire [google/earthengine-api](https://github.com/google/earthengine-api) repository.
